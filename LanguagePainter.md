# Introduction #

PowerPoint 2007's handling of different languages is weird. For example the keyboard layout you're using influences the language PowerPoint assumes when you input text. Switching between keyboard layouts has immediate effect on the current editing language in PowerPoint.

While it is nice if you are used to the language's specific keyboard layout it is kind of painful if you are not and for example just want to create English presentations with a German keyboard layout.

PowerPoint LanguagePainter attempts to fix this by allowing you to force edited text to use a certain language for spelling checks, etc.

When you install the add-in, it will add a new toggle button to the Home ribbon:

If you toggle the "Paint `[...]`" button, it will automatically set the text you're editing to the language specified (regardless of your keyboard layout, etc.). If you click on the lower half of the button, a combo menu will pop up offering you several language choices - at the moment English (US), German, French and Spanish are supported.
